To run the commands in this directory (I.E. save_project.sh) type in the following

./save_project.sh

if it doesn't work check to make sure that:

	1. It is spelled correctly
	2. There are no spaces
	3. You are in the project directory

To check item number 3, type

pwd

into the shell. It should match the file path to where the project file is.
For example, my project is in Z:\thermo\project. When I'm in the right place pwd prints out


/z/thermo/ees_project

If you aren't in the right place first type

cd

this will bring you back to your Z:\ drive. Then you want to type in

cd /rest/of/path/to/project

so for my example I would type

cd
cd /thermo/ees_project

If you want to make sure you can type

ls

This will show you everything in whatever folder you're in.
